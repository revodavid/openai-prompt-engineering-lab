# Recap: What we've learned

We hope that in the last hour, you've learned what natural language generative AI models are and how they work, how to access them in Azure OpenAI Service, and started on the path to building applications with them. Here are some key points to remember:

* Generative AI models can generate humanlike text, images, and code
* Generative AI models are stateless: they do not learn, and are constrained by their training data which is frozen at a fixed point in time
* Azure OpenAI Service is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 from OpenAI with the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
* Azure OpenAI Service provides a simple REST API for accessing these models
* Prompt engineering is a technique for "grounding" generative AI models, and can be used to influence the style of their output, provide factual information, and constrain their behavior.

## Additional Resources
