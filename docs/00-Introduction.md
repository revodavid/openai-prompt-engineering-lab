# Introduction 

The goal of this 45-minute lab is to:
* Understand the implementation and capabilities of the GPT-3.5 family of models
* Learn how to use and customize natural language generative AI models using prompt engineering techniques
* Understand the basics of integrating OpenAI models into applications with the API

## Pre-requisites

You will need either an Azure Account or an OpenAI account to complete this lab. 

If you do not have an Azure Account, you can create one [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and receive credits to create and use the services you will use for this lab.

The instructions in this lab refer to the experience using Azure OpenAI Service. There are slight differences when using OpenAI services, which are dicussed in the next section.
