# Explore the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Models

This session is a 60-minute live demonstration of interaction with OpenAI models GPT-3.5 Instruct (gpt-35-turbo-instruct) and GPT-3.5 Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo). You can follow along with the demonstration live using Use [Azure AI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal) or [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground), or work through the examples in this repository later at your own pace and schedule.

The goal of this 60-minute session is to:
  * Understand the implementation and capabilities of the GPT-3.5 family of models
  * Learn how to use and customize natural language generative AI models using prompt engineering techniques
  * Understand the basics of integrating OpenAI models into applications with the API
